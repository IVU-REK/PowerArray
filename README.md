# PowerArray
Power Array extends the Array prototype by adding many additional features.

<b>What does this script changes on the Array prototype?</b>
Nothing, it just add new functions and properties, and only if they were not already used.

<h2>Main functions</h2>
The following examples consider the following array:<br>
<code>var elements = [
      {id : 1, firstName : 'Max', lastName: 'Muster', age : 30}, 
      {id : 2, firstName : 'Peter', lastName: 'Pan', age : 70},
      {id : 3, firstName : 'Jochen', lastName: 'MÃ¼ller', age : 4},
  ]</code>

<ul><li><h3>Where(whereConditions, keepOrder)</h3></li></ul>

I'll continue writting, sorry :)
